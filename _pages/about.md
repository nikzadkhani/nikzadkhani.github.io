Hi! I recently graduated Boston University studying computer science. I focused mostly in machine learning and researched under [Professor Derry Wijaya](https://derrywijaya.github.io/web/) at the LLAMA 🦙 lab, where we published [this](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.19/). Afterwards, I wanted to explore other fields of ML like reinforcement learning where I did this.  

Outside of my studies, you can find me playing tennis 
🎾, chess ♟️, hiking ⛰️ or biking 🚴🏽.
