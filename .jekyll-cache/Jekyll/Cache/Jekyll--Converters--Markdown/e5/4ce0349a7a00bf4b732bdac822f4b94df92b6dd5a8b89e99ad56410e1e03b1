<p>The main goal of q-learning and really a lot of other reinforcement learning algorithms is to learn an optimal policy which is
usually symbolized as $\pi$. This boils down to finding the action in every scenario that will give us the best outcome. The
policy that does this the best is called the optimal policy which is usually symbolized as $\pi^*$. Q-learning is in algorithm
to find this policy using what is called a $Q$ function.</p>
