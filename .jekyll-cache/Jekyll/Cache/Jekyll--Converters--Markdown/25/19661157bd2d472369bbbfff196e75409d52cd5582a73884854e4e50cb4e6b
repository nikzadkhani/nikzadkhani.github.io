I"<p>Hi! I recently graduated Boston University studying computer science. I focused mostly in machine learning and researched under <a href="https://derrywijaya.github.io/web/">Professor Derry Wijaya</a> at the LLAMA 🦙 lab, where we published <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.19/">this</a>. Afterwards, I wanted to explore other fields of ML like reinforcement learning where I did this.</p>

<p>Outside of my studies, you can find me playing tennis 
🎾, chess ♟️, hiking ⛰️ or biking 🚴🏽.</p>
